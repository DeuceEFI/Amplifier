### Tasks to left to do:

* Layout PCB.
* Review all parts and layout.

----------

### TODO Changes Completed:

* Created Amplifier.mod KiCAD module. - DONE 06/01/2013
* Created Output-Inductor footprint. - DONE 06/01/2013
* Zobel resistors are 5mm diameter with comfortable 21mm lead spacing. - DONE 06/02/2013
* 1000uF decouple are 16.2 OD, 0.8 lead dia, 7.3 lead spacing. - DONE 06/02/2013
* 100uF caps (both types) are 8.2 OD, 0.5 lead dia, 3 lead spacing. - DONE 06/02/2013
* 10uF are tantalum and are 4 OD, 0.5 lead dia, 4.9 lead spacing. - DONE 06/02/2013
* Triple decouple ceramics all have 5 lead spacing and 0.5 lead dia, the thickest one is about 2.5, so the three side by side should give a spacing of 5 total centre to centre from 1uF to 0.01uF. - DONE 06/02/2013
* The MKT 1uF caps are a bit under 4.5mm wide, and 7.2 in the lead spacing direction with 0.5 wire dia, and 5 lead spacing. Note that the input DC block "cap" is three of these in parallel. The remaining one is for the Zobel network. - DONE 06/02/2013
* Resistors are std 1/4 package except for Zobel network resistors. - DONE 06/02/2013
* Diodes are std 1N4007 parts. - DONE 06/02/2013
