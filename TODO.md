# To Do List

## JAG 06/01/2013 1534 EDT (GMT-0400)

### Tasks to left to do:

* Create footprints for amplifier IC and custom inductors.
* Zobel resistors are 5 diameter with comfortable 21 lead spacing
* 1000uF decouple are 16.2 OD, 0.8 lead dia, 7.3 lead spacing
* 100uF caps (both types) are 8.2 OD, 0.5 lead dia, 3 lead spacing
* 10uF are tantalum and are 4 OD, 0.5 lead dia, 4.9 lead spacing
* Triple decouple ceramics all have 5 lead spacing and 0.5 lead dia, the thickest one is about 2.5, so the three side by side should give a spacing of 5 total centre to centre from 1uF to 0.01uF
* The MKT 1uF caps are a bit under 4.5mm wide, and 7.2 in the lead spacing direction with 0.5 wire dia, and 5 lead spacing. Note that the input DC block "cap" is three of these in parallel. The remaining one is for the Zobel network.
* Resistors are std 1/4 package except for Zobel network resistors
* Diodes are std 1N4007 parts
* Layout PCB.

----------

### TODO Changes Completed:

* Created Amplifier.mod KiCAD module.
* Created Output-Inductor footprint.
